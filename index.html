<h2>What is an Urban Food Desert?</h1>
<P>An urban food desert is a geographic area in which residents have little to no access to healthy, affordable food. We tend to find urban food deserts in low-income areas, typically consisting of minorities such as Latinos and African Americans. In these areas, we tend to see the food options that are available to these residents are typically gas stations and corner/conveniences stores, with very little access to grocery stores. Although these places do provide food, the selection on what to eat is also very limited and often, unhealthy. Urban food deserts demonstrate how some residents are being geographically and economically discriminated based on the resource that are being provided to them.</P>

<h3>Why Are Urban Food Deserts an Issue?</h2>
<p>Urban food deserts are in issue because most of these residents in these areas don't realize they are living in an urban food desert. These residents are unaware of the variety of food options they could have and what is better for them because of the lack of availability of what they can buy, make, and eat. In Chicago, we see that about 500,000 residents, most are African American, live in food deserts. Residents are unaware of the variety of different fruits and vegetables because they have no access to them. Due to the lack of access, it can take a toll on a family economically as well as their health. These families are just making it work and a lot of these families may think that if their family has a roof over their heads, they are fed, and they can get to work/school tomorrow, everything is working. That is not the case. Those with little access to healthy food options are prone chronic illness. It has been found that the chronic illness includes diabetes, high cholesterol, and poor cardiac health. These residents are more likely to be ill because of the availability of food options. If these residents do not have the option to be able to eat right, we are giving them more issues to worry about. As stated before, the residents of these communities do not realize the correlation between the two. The lack of resources in a community is also an issue because residents also suffer from the lack of transportation like trains and buses. Because they are putting all their hard-earned money towards rent, most of these families cannot afford their own transportation such as cars and gas. In Chicago, about 400,000 residents live in areas with a lot of fast-food restaurants are available to them, but no grocery stores. Transportation is an issue because of where these grocery stores are located. It is unfair to those who have to travel out of their neighborhood to even have the option to buy healthy foods. Because residents are unaware of that they are living in urban food deserts and do not have the access to different kinds of foods, they tend to also have little education on how important it is to eat healthy which impacts their health severely. If these residents are never given access to specific vegetables, they would not have any knowledge on how to implement them into their cooking.<p>

<h4>How Can We Solve This Issue?</h3>
<P>We can solve the issue of urban food deserts by keeping up with where they are located and lending more resources to those communities and who need it more rather than continuing to supply to those who are already better off. Keeping track of where they are located also helps reminds us that this is still a problem, rather than just forgetting and/or dismissing the issue. This can also help prevent them from continuing to grow and spread. Education is another important factor that can help solve this issue. If residents are not aware of their living conditions and knowing that there are better, healthier options for them, urban food deserts will continue to keep growing. Schools should be able to help educate on these issues and the importance of eating healthy. We see empty parking lots that can be used as a shared garden for everyone to learn how to grow vegetables and fruits and be able to obtain food from there since Chicago housing does not have a lot of backyard space. It is also a part of the government job to help their residents. Our government can help create laws and regulations to help the issue as well as bring awareness. With more places that accept SNAP, residents have more options to be able to buy food that offer a variety, rather than feeling left out.  </P>
